  <h1>New & Lesser Known Terminal Editors</h1>

  <article class="entry">
    <a href="https://micro-editor.github.io/"><h2>micro</h2></a>
    <p class="description">
      Micro is a terminal-based text editor that aims to be easy to use and intuitive, while also taking advantage of the full capabilities of modern terminals. It comes as one single, batteries-included, static binary with no dependencies, and you can download and use it right now. Micro aims to be somewhat of a successor to the nano editor by being easy to install and use in a pinch, but micro also aims to be enjoyable to use full time.
